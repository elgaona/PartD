From this cool effect that I found while playing the video game, Fifa 18, I really enjoyed the camera view. In this specific scene I enjoy all the differnt colors going on. I enjoy the sun becuase it reflects based on the shape of the top of the stadium. It's awesome to see the audience in the stadium wearing different clothing depending where they are sitting and who they are rooting for.

I feel it was created by making idividual players and incorporating them to the game. I also believe the stadium was made the material that becomes the boundaries of the game. The rest of the characters are based on the type of character it is, player or fan. 

After the goalie kicks the ball, the camera view changes. It goes to landscape mode in order for the user to be able to see the entire field. The game goes on and the camera changes when there is another goal kick. There is something always checking if the ball goes out of bounds. Then it checks where on the field the ball went out of bounds in. After that, the camera changes or stays the same. If it is a goal kick it will change back to the goalie in order to kick out. 

The field updates the geometry on its own. It is evident the camera's center depends on where in the field the soccer ball is located. Since the televsion can't neccessairly show the entire soccer field, the camera view is always changing. The geometry changes in order for the camera to move with the action of play. Also, the texture changes across the field. The texture changes when one end of the field is reached. The camera shows goals and an area box. Compared to the middle of the field that has a big circle in the middle of the field.
